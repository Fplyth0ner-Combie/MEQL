# MEQL
MultiEye EDR Expression Query Language

# What is it
The project contains constantly updated examples of threat hunting queries for MultiEye EDR, and it also includes a complete language grammar manual (which is constantly being updated).

# Why is it here
We want users to learn our threat hunting capabilities, rather than repeatedly calling us to help. We don't want our users to be completely ignorant of security (that's just an aspiration). \
We also want to help security practitioners quickly and accurately find the exploit traces of serious vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild by publishing targeted statements. \
You can understand these expressions even if you are not currently using our security products. It is applicable and easily portable.
